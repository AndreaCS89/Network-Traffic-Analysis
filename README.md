# Network-Traffic-Analysis

I am a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT services for clients. Several customers of clients reported that they were not able to access the client company website www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and saw the error “destination port unreachable” after waiting for the page to load. 

For this activity, I was tasked with analyzing the data presented to me from the tcpdump log, identify trends in the data, and to assess which protocol is producing the error message from the DNS server for the yummyrecipesforme.com website.Then, I was expected to create a cybersecurity incident report regarding the network traffic analysis in which I had to include, at least, the following: 

- A brief summary of the tcpdump log analysis and indentification of which protocols were used for the network traffic.
  
- Details about what was indicated in the log.
  
- Interpretations about the issues found in the log.

Once the traffic log had been inspected and trends in the traffic were identified, I had to describe why the error messages appeared on the log. To do that, I had to use my previous answers and the scenario to identify the reason behind the ICMP error messages. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with a specific port. For this part of the activity, I was expected to do the following:


- State when the problem was first reported.

- Provide the scenario, events, and symptoms identified when the event was first reported.

- Explain the current status of the issue.  

- Describe the information discovered while investigating the issue up to this point.

- List the next steps in troubleshooting and resolving the issue.

- Provide the suspected root cause of the problem.
